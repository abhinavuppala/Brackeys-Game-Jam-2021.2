My submission for the Brackeys 2021.2 Game Jam - Apocalypse Runner

Apocalypse Runner is a 3D side-view platformer game in which the player navigates a landscape with obstacles, lava, and moving platforms while utilizing power-ups to reach the bunker at the end of the level. The game features over 21 levels, not including a main menu & end screen, along with several types of platforms & powerups to keep gameplay dynamic and interesting. Levels start off simpler, gradually introducing new mechanics to the player in order to ensure players, but eventually become much longer.

This game was completely developed by myself, in a 1-week time limit as a submission for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2, with no external resources or assets. The modeling & UI is very basic and lackluster; this is because I was on a time constraint and prioritized those as last. Additionally, my modeling skills are not good. Since this was my first ever game jam, let alone my first game developed by myself, I made the game concept simple, and focused on making as good gameplay as I could make with my capability at the time.
